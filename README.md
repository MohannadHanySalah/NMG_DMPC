This paper develops a distributed load frequency control design that employs Model Predictive Control (MPC) within a leader-follower control scheme based on graph theory for networked microgrid (NMG) systems. The proposed NMG model contains three equivalent microgrids (MGs) with fully connected topologies that share tie-lines between them. Each MG includes diesel generators, renewable energy sources, and energy storage systems. The mathematical model was depicted through state-space notations. The frequency control system employed Laplacian-based distributed control, which selected MG1 as the leader to receive information from neighbouring MG2 and MG3, thus minimising communication needs without compromising stability or performance. A basic centralised MPC controller was tested in the model against a variable load for all MGs, and then the results were compared with the proposed distributed MPC (DMPC). The DMPC implementation resulted in superior performance, as it achieved a consistent settling time of just 5 s, which is 2.5 times faster than centralised MPC (12–60 s) and over 28 times faster than PID control (140–180 s), while maintaining steady‑state error below 0.07 Hz for system frequency control after its testing phase
